### Experience  
Backend engineer working primarily with Go, TypeScript, Python, Java, and Shell Script.
Particularly passionate about Go, focusing on API development, system operations, and CI/CD improvements.

Currently a student and a freelance developer, working under a sole proprietorship contract.
Starting in April, I will be joining a traditional Japanese company (JTC) as an IT Engineer while continuing my contract-based development as a side job.

In my free time, I enjoy building various utility tools to enhance productivity, especially in Go.
