## Experience  
Backend engineer working primarily with Go, TypeScript, Python, Java, and Shell Script.
Particularly passionate about Go, focusing on API development, system operations, and CI/CD improvements.  

Previously a student and a freelance developer working under a sole proprietorship contract.
Now, I have joined a traditional Japanese company (JTC) as an IT Engineer while continuing my contract-based development as a side job.  

In my free time, I enjoy building various utility tools to enhance productivity, especially in Go.



## Hobbies
I enjoy reading, watching movies, and listening to music. I’m particularly passionate about club music, especially genres like UK Garage, UK Hardcore, UK Bass, Rhythm & Blues (R&B), and Drum & Bass (DnB). I’m always open to exploring new sounds and experiences. I keep track of my music listening habits on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/ja/user/shiyui), where I log my favorite tracks and discover new artists.

As for movies, I’m a fan of works by Christopher Nolan and enjoy films that challenge conventional storytelling.
